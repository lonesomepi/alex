# CLAS Recognition Plugin
This plugin provides the CLAS Recognition website with special functionality and templates.

## Functionality
### Gravity Forms
For Summer 2020, CLAS Recognition created a form that will gather student's names, emails, and images. In order to prevent files being uploaded without the student's name, this plugin includes a function that will overwrite the file uploaded with the name LastName-FirstName-Filename.jpg (example Smith-John-DSC_3421.jpg).

### Templates
